UF CLAS InfoBlox Allow list maintenance

This project contains code to access the InfoBlox IP Management system at the University of Florida for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The code is designed to remove MAC addresses from the DHCP Allow list for devices that have been damaged, taken out of service, or otherwise no longer used by the college.

Access to the InfoBlox system is only available from within the UF Campus network. A UF GatorLink account and password is required and depends on a user account having privileges to make the necessary changes.
